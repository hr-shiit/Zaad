# CreatorShares - Web3 Monetization for Content Creators

CreatorShares is a decentralized platform built with Solidity and Next.js that enables content creators to pitch their video ideas and raise funding from their audience. Users can buy shares in a creator's video project and earn a portion of the revenue after the content is published.

## Key Features

- Creator Pitches: Creators submit proposals for video content.
- Share Investment: Users can purchase shares in content projects.
- Revenue Sharing: 80% (or a custom percentage) of revenue is distributed to shareholders after 120 days of publication.
- Smart Contracts: Revenue is managed transparently and securely on-chain.
- Next.js Frontend: Modern and responsive UI with Web3 integration.

## How It Works

1. A creator submits a pitch with video details, funding goal, and revenue share terms.
2. Users can invest in the pitch by purchasing shares.
3. Once fully funded, the creator produces and publishes the video.
4. After 120 days from publishing, revenue generated by the video is collected.
5. 80% of the total revenue is distributed proportionally to shareholders via the smart contract.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js, TailwindCSS, Wagmi, Ethers.js
- Smart Contracts: Solidity (Ethereum-compatible blockchain)
- Backend (optional): Node.js, IPFS
- Wallet Integration: MetaMask, WalletConnect
